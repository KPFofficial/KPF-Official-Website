		<p>KPF, or KAIST Presidential Fellowship, is a group of students specially recruited by the university based on their exceptional academic achievements and research capabilities. We seek to develop all merits we have through constructive mutual interactions within and extending over the organisation. The members of KPF work toward achieving such goals by building benevolent relationships, starting with the local community and expanding the network to whomever making efforts for the shared goal. Realising our position in the international community is among our greatest emphases, only in understanding as the world is one which we all share, we have our portion in it, in both of the perspectives of learning and offering.</p>
